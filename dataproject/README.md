# Data Analysis Project

Our Data Analysis Project consists of 2 main parts. In the first part we analyze the current YTD development of the S&P 500 American Index, by examining the index and index-yield from the API of the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). Our approach is primarily visual representations, and we end up with visually and qualitatively being able to conclude that the development of the index increases in volatility with the out-break of the Covid-19 in the United States of America. That is both the extraordinary declines and large positive day-to-day increments of the index.
The second part of our project initially cleans and structures data of the private consumption from danish households, as well as data from the OMX C25 Cap Index. Both data sets are extracted from the Danish Statistics API. After the cleansing, structuring and merging of the data, we visually represent the development in the two different factors, during the same period of increasing and declining business cycles. The intent is to compare and observe any correlation between the danish stock market as a proxy of the fitness of the economy, with the consumption of the general public. 

The results with corresponding notes can be seen by running the notebook from this folder.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, our project also requires the following installations:

``pip install HVILKE PAKKER bruger vi?``
